Things to add:
=========================

gameSetup.set_commands():
    Add fighting and stealing and buying items later
    And "use" for items
    Maybe add a map item later?  But make it hard to get

gameSetup.set_rooms():
    ***Need to add the rooms + items
    Maybe add "up" and "down"?  (And ascend/descend/climb for actions?)
    Add death if you enter certain rooms with a light or weapon or something

Other:
    Add health and money?
    Battles + odds of hit/miss (rand/roll dice)
    *NPC who will give you an item if you win a dice game, but if you lose you lose an item?
     (at random, and chance you don't lose anything, or you die?)
    Add enemies
    ***Write conversation trees
        NEED ALL NPC TREES TO HAVE A DEFAULT FIRST "reply" FROM THE PLAYER
        (maps "what PC says" to "what NPC can says")

Characters' data structures
Structures/methods for map + interactions
Basic command parsing/input

NEXT WEEK:
